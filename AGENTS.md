# 🧠 Usable MCP - SYSTEM PROMPT (LONG-TERM MEMORY)

This is your main way of storing and fetching data. Always consult it before
starting a task and whenever you need more context.

Detailed instructions for each tool are embedded in its MCP description; read
them before you call the tool.

## Search Discipline

- Start or resume every task with `agentic-search-fragments` and rerun whenever
  scope expands or you lack certainty.
- Provide workspace scope and begin with `repo:usable-discord-bot` tags; iterate
  until the tool reports `decision: "SUFFICIENT"`.
- If the agentic tool is unavailable, fall back to `search-memory-fragments`,
  then return to the agentic loop as soon as possible.
- Respect the tool's safety rails—if you see `invocationLimitReached: true`,
  stop rerunning the tool and document the uncovered gap instead. Reset the
  attempt counter whenever you start a materially different search objective.
- Use `get-memory-fragment-content` for deep dives on selected fragment IDs and
  cite titles plus timestamps in your responses.

## Planning Loop

- **Plan**: Outline sub-goals and the tools you will invoke.
- **Act**: Execute tools exactly as their descriptions prescribe, keeping
  actions minimal and verifiable.
- **Reflect**: After each tool batch, summarise coverage, note freshness, and
  decide whether to iterate or escalate.

## Verification & Documentation

- Verify code (lint, tests, manual checks) or obtain user confirmation before
  relying on conclusions.
- Capture verified insights by using `create-memory-fragment` or
  `update-memory-fragment`; include repository tags and residual risks so the
  team benefits immediately.

## Freshness & Escalation

- Prefer fragments updated within the last 90 days; flag stale sources.
- If internal knowledge conflicts or is insufficient after 2–3 iterations,
  escalate to external research and reconcile findings with workspace standards.

Repository: usable-discord-bot Workspace: Flowcore Fragment Types Available:
knowledge, recipe, solution, template, feature request, instruction set, issue,
llm persona, llm rules, plan, prd, research, violation exception

## Fragment Type Mapping

The following fragment types are available in this workspace:

- **Knowledge**: General information, documentation, and reference material
- **Recipe**: Step-by-step guides, tutorials, and procedures
- **Solution**: Solutions to specific problems and troubleshooting guides
- **Template**: Reusable code patterns, project templates, and boilerplates
- **Feature Request**: A Feature request for products we develop, these should
  be tagged by the repo it is tied to and the product name
- **Instruction Set**: A set of instructions for the LLM to perform a set of
  actions, like setting up a project, installing a persona etc.
- **Issue**: Issues and bug reported in various systems developed by Flowcore
- **LLM Persona**: This is a Persona that the LLM can impersonate. This should
  help the LLM to tackle more complex and specific problems
- **LLM Rules**: LLM rules that can be converted into for example cursor or
  other ide or llm powered rules engine
- **Plan**: A plan, usually tied to a repository
- **PRD**: A Product requirements document for a project or feature, usually
  targeted for a repository
- **Research**: Research information done with the express purpose of being
  implemented at a later date.
- **Violation Exception**: Violation exceptions and reasons for these exceptions
  and who authorised them, these need to contain the Github username that
  approved them and the repository and commit they are tied to as well as a
  detailed explanation of why the exception is made.

## Fragment Type Cheat Sheet

- **Knowledge:** reference material, background, concepts.
- **Recipe:** human step-by-step guides and tutorials.
- **Solution:** fixes, troubleshooting steps, postmortems.
- **Template:** reusable code/config patterns.
- **Instruction Set:** automation workflows for the LLM to execute.
- **Plan:** roadmaps, milestones, "what/when" documents.
- **PRD:** product/feature requirements and specs.

Before choosing, review the workspace fragment type mapping to spot custom types
that may fit better than the defaults.

Quick picker: “How to…” → Recipe · “Fix…” → Solution · “Plan for…” → Plan ·
“Requirements…” → PRD · “What is…” → Knowledge · “Reusable pattern…” → Template
· “LLM should execute…” → Instruction Set.
